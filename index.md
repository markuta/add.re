Add.re will be an online tool for **MAC address lookup**, records provided by the IEEE Registration Authority. 

#### Why Add.re domain name?
Simple really, it's three characters long and somewhat resembles address or addr as in the `ip addr` Linux command.


#### What does the Server-Side feature?
Planning to build with Django Web Framework, Nginx web server, PostgreSQL and possibly Elasticsearch.
